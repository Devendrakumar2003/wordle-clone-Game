Game
Wordle is a popular online word puzzle game where players try to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. 
The game provides feedback on each guess by indicating whether each letter in the guessed word is in the correct position (marked with green) or 
if the letter exists in the target word but is in the wrong position (marked with yellow). Players use these hints to deduce the target word correctly.
